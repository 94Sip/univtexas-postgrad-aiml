# univtexas-postgrad-aiml
This repository contains all the projects I did (independently) as part of the post graduate AIML course from the University of Texas and Great Learning, over the course of approximately 6 months.

Most of these cases utilized datasets which can be found on Kaggle, but were provided via Great Learning.
The deep learning cases (MLP, CNN) utilized Google Colab, as you will see in the notebooks.

The general curriculum we followed (which corresponds to what the cases demonstrate) is:

	Deep dive into Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using online movie reviews
	Using Logistic Regression to predict marketing program success for Bank Loans
	Utilization of Ensemble methods, inlcusing Decision Trees, Boosting, Bagging, Random Forests, and dealing with imbalanced classes to predict Bank Term Deposit marketing.
	Conduct Feature Engineering, Lasso/Ridge Regression, Polynomial Features, Cross-Validation, Pipelines, and Hyperparameter tuning to predict concrete strength
	Using KMeans and Agglomerative Clustering to perform Customer Segmentation for Credit Card marketing programs
	Using Neural Networks (Deep Learning) to predict Customer Churn modeling
	Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify seedlings vs weeds
	Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to conduct Sentiment Analysis of US Airline Tweets
