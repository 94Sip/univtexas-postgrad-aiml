# univtexas-postgrad-aiml
This repository contains all the projects I did (independently) as part of the post graduate AIML course from the University of Texas and Great Learning, over the course of approximately 6 months.

Most of these cases utilized datasets which can be found on Kaggle, but were provided via Great Learning. 
The deep learning cases (MLP, CNN) utilized Google Colab, as you will see in the notebooks.

The general curriculum we followed (which corresponds to what the cases demonstrate) is:

Exploratory Data Analysis (completed)
Logistic Regression (completed)
Ensemble methods: Decision Trees, Boosting, Bagging, Random Forests. This case also demonstrated dealing with imbalanced classes. (completed)
Feature Engineering: Lasso/Ridge Regression, Polynomial Features, Cross-Validation, Pipelines, Hyperparameter tuning (RandomizedSearchCV) (completed)
Customer Segmentation (Clustering): KMeans and Agglomerative Clustering (completed)
Customer Churn modeling with Neural Networks (completed)
Seedling Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (Completed)
Sentiment Analysis of US Airline Tweets (Completed)
